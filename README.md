A Tesla Powerwall Controller!

## How it works

Connected to a MySQL database storing National Grid data, the program utilises forecasted solar production to predict how much electricity from solar my area will produce prior to 4pm.
Using this information, I can estimate to an accuracy of 90%~ how much I need to charge between 2am-5am to ensure the Tesla Powerwall Battery is at 100% by 4pm.

The information of this database can be seen at: https://www.going-green.live

## Key Information

  - Between 2am and 5am, electricity can be bought at its lowest rate.
  - Between 4pm and 7pm, electricity can be sold at its highest rate.
  - Any electricity bought between 2am and 5am can be sold for a profit between 4pm and 7pm.
